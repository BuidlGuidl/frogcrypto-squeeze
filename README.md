## üê∏ What Are CryptoFrogs?

CryptoFrogs are unique, programmable cryptographic collectibles introduced at **Devcon 7**. They were minted as part of an initiative to introduce attendees to programmable cryptography in a fun and engaging way. These frogs can now be squeezed using this application, adding a playful layer of interaction to the collectibles.

## üöÄ Features

- **Zupass Integration**: Seamlessly connect your Zupass to interact with your CryptoFrogs.
- **Frog Squeezing**: A playful and interactive way to engage with your frogs.
- **On-Chain Proof Verification**: Built with cutting-edge cryptographic proof verification to ensure secure and transparent interactions.


## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Details

This project leverages **on-chain GPC proof verification** to ensure secure and verifiable interactions with CryptoFrogs. The implementation is based on the following principles:

1. **Zupass Integration**: The application uses Zupass, a decentralized identity and proof system, to authenticate users and verify ownership of CryptoFrogs.
2. **On-Chain Proofs**: The squeezing process involves generating and verifying cryptographic proofs directly on-chain, ensuring transparency and trust.
2. **Frontend Circuit Data**: The frontend retrieves the circuit data required to send to the smart contract for verification. You can find the relevant code [here](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/frogcrypto-squeeze/blob/a694e147a8f1d55df270471e1174761a4a52ec7f/packages/nextjs/app/page.tsx#L155).
3. **Smart Contract Verification**: The smart contract verifies the proof data sent from the front end. First, it verifies known constants, then the attributes, and finally, the proof. The verification logic is implemented [here](https://github.com/BuidlGuidl/frogcrypto-squeeze/blob/main/packages/hardhat/contracts/FrogCryptoSqueeze.sol#L84).

This architecture ensures that the ownership of CryptoFrogs is provable and verifiable in a decentralized manner.
